- üó∫Ô∏è How do different products perform in various regions?
- :atom: What are the demographic details of our customers?
- üîç Can we identify our best customers? 
- ‚åõ How can we identify trends and patterns in sales data over time?

# Designs & Thought Process
- Color scheme is derived from company's logo, consisting of Cyan, Black and White.
- Red colorings are utilized to indicate issues that negatively impact the company e.g. return rate or when targets aren't met.
- Customer Details segment was created to target our best and worst customers, which would likely require different marketing approaches to generate additional revenue. 
- Side bars were inserted to allow users to easily go through the 4 different tabs.
